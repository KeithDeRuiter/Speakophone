# Speakophone
An application to generate spoken audio based on allophones from C64 samples.
This repository also contains a dice roller app to generate verbal responses to queries about rolling different dice.  The default sample sounds for the dice roller app were created using the Speakophone application with a set of standard phrases.

## Dependencies
This application was developed using the following primary packages, installed using Anaconda:

* Python 3.7
* numpy
* scipy
* python-sounddevice

It also contains a Spyder project file.  If there is an error loading modules or locating sounddevice, it may need to be installed using pip rather than using the distribution provided on conda-forge, not sure why at the moment.
